synopsis: Twenty-eight days after a killer virus was accidentally unleashed from a
  British research facility, a small group of London survivors are caught in a desperate
  struggle to protect themselves from the infected. Carried by animals and humans,
  the virus turns those it infects into homicidal maniacs -- and it's absolutely impossible
  to contain.
