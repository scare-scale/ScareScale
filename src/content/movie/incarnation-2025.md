Using her ability as a medium, Talia exorcises the demon and helps Detective Oh investigate a series of chain suicides. They uncover that Thuy's mother, Chao, a shaman from Vietnam, uses a curse called \"Go\" to drive people to suicide. When Talia learns Chao plans to pass the curse onto Thuy's daughter Jin, she decides to sacrifice herself by taking the curse into her own body. As she prepares for her fate, Talia is confronted with an unexpected truth."
