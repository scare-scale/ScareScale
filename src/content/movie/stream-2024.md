synopsis: "Craven, a streamer with thousands of followers on a live streaming platform, has prepared a very special stream for Halloween. What no one expects when reacting to a video of Pentagram, a group of young paranormal investigators, is that the live experience will turn into the worst night of their lives. And maybe... the last."
