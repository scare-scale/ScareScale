After separating due to his unpredictable alcohol infused temper, Frank try to win his wife Laura back by giving her a beautiful antique necklace he finds in an old 1938 evidence bag at the station. Unfortunately, the necklace is a conduit for the tormented soul of an evil boy from long ago, and Laura and her daughters find themselves in terrible danger from a little boy who no longer exists.
