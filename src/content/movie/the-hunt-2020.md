synopsis: "Twelve strangers wake up in a clearing. They don't know where they areâ€”or how they got there. In the shadow of a dark internet conspiracy theory, ruthless elitists gather at a remote location to hunt humans for sport. But their master plan is about to be derailed when one of the hunted turns the tables on her pursuers."
