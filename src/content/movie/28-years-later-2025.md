synopsis: Twenty-eight years since the rage virus escaped a biological weapons laboratory,
  now, still in a ruthlessly enforced quarantine, some have found ways to exist amidst
  the infected. One such group lives on a small island connected to the mainland by
  a single, heavily-defended causeway. When one member departs on a mission into the
  dark heart of the mainland, he discovers secrets, wonders, and horrors that have
  mutated not only the infected but other survivors as well.
