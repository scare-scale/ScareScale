synopsis: Since the 1960s, a disproportionate number of the population in and around
  Nome, Alaska, have gone missing. Despite FBI investigations, the disappearances
  remain a mystery. Dr. Abigail Tyler, a psychologist, may be on the verge of blowing
  the unsolved cases wide open when, during the course of treating her patients, she
  finds evidence of alien abductions.
