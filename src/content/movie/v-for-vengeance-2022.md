After learning that their younger sibling escaped an earlier kidnapping attempt that also killed their parents, two estranged sisters must join forces to rescue her from a group of bloodthirsty vampires. Out for revenge and control of a vampirism vaccine, Thorn and his band of the undead soon learn that they messed with the wrong family.
