Paranormal investigators Kris, Celina and their videographer Jay are rerouted to an abandoned house deep in the woods, where they find themselves facing a force unlike anything they've encountered before. As the night spirals into chaos, missing crew members and eerie phenomena hint at an ancient, malevolent presence watching their every move.
