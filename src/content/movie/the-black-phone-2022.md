synopsis: "Finney Blake, a shy but clever 13-year-old boy, is abducted by a sadistic\
  \ killer and trapped in a soundproof basement where screaming is of little use.\
  \ When a disconnected phone on the wall begins to ring, Finney discovers that he\
  \ can hear the voices of the killer\u2019s previous victims. And they are dead set\
  \ on making sure that what happened to them doesn\u2019t happen to Finney."
